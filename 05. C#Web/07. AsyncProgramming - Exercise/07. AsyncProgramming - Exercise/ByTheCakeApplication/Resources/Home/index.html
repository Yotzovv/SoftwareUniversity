    <h3 id="cakes">Our Cakes</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Cake</em></strong> is a form of <em><strong>sweet</strong></em> dessert that is typically baked. In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</p>
